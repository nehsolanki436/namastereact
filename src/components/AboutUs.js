           <h2>About Me</h2>
           <p className="details-me">Hi, I am Neha Solanki, a 29 year old Software Developer living in Mumbai.<br/>
              Currently, I am working with some awesome folks at NEC Software Solutions.<br></br>
              At NEC, I am converting wireframes into live web pages which makes UK Government folks happy. <br/>
              And this has developed my interest towards FrontEnd Technologies. So, trying my hands on React.js.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Speaking more about me I love hiking and enjoy exploring nature.<br></br>
              I also enjoy cooking by the way I make great Basundi!!
